crude Polar H10 ECG ESP32 example for testing purpose only
Blinks the ESP32S3 dev board onboard NeoPixel LED in a ECG-like manner using the ECG notifications sent from the Polar H10
Thanks BleakHeart project for the possible H10 ECG data format
Thanks NimBLE and adafruit_NeoPixe3l for the library.

Most code generated by AI so don't feed it back.

could run with latest arduino and library version up to the commit time.

Notes:
Don't use Serial to debug,latest Adafruit Neopixel doesn't like that and gives rmt tx channel errors. Try another library if you want.
Don't use Strings type, same reason.
Why delay(5)? AI gives it that datapoint time should be around 7ms and neopixel takes about 1ms, so delay(5). Improve it if you want.
Since NimBLE updated and active scanning with callback is broken for a while for AI generated code,I used the non-callback code from the NimBLE doc. If it doesn't connect at the first time,press the RESET button and wait about 15 secs. You can also add retry code.

There is a version for cheap HR-band without ECG too. You could try it out if you don't have a H10.
